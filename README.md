# leaflet-challenge

This has the javascript code for week 15 challenge.

In this challenge we attempt to create a visualization of a map of earthquakes in the last 30 days. We want markers for each earthquake and want the markers to be represented by the size using the radius of the marker and color. This will all be shown on an html website.
